# HOW TO RUN OUR PROJECT
To run our projects, you simply need to go through the notebook run.ipynb cells in the chronological order. The implementations are in the implementations.py file. We use some functions of the helpers.py provided for the labs. The submission-logistic_regerssion.csv file contains the last prediction made by the model.
